### The problems of Large-Scale Public Demonstrations Against Right-Leaning Politics:

**1. Lack of Dialogue and Tribal Bubbles:**

  - Demonstrations often fail to promote dialogue between opposing sides, contributing to a more polarized environment.
  - Reinforces existing tribal bubbles where individuals surround themselves with like-minded people, hindering the exchange of diverse perspectives.
  - Focusing on a "common enemy" rather than addressing specific disagreements may create short-term unity but can undermine efforts to find common ground on specific issues.


**2. Vagueness of Terms and Labeling:**

  - Using terms like "right-wing" or "anti-democratic" in a broad or undefined manner can oversimplify complex political ideologies and stifle nuanced discussions.
  - Inflationary use of terms like "Nazi" diminishes the gravity of historical atrocities and can undermine legitimate criticism by diluting the meaning of such labels.

 

**3. Convenient for Politicians in Power:**

  - Large-scale demonstrations that focus on a generic "enemy" divert attention from specific issues, allowing politicians to avoid accountability.
  - The urgency created by a perceived external threat overshadow the need for critical examination of government policies and performance.


**4. Use of Public Shaming:**

  - Demonstrations resort to public shaming tactics, potentially stifling open discourse and discouraging individuals from expressing opposing views.
  - Public shaming creates a climate of fear, where individuals are hesitant to engage in constructive debates or express dissenting opinions.


**5. Motivations Beyond Political Views:**

  - Some participants join demonstrations without a well-thought-out political view, driven more by the social atmosphere and feel-good experience rather than a commitment to specific causes. I often have heard comments such as
    * "Demos are soo much fun"
    * "It was just beautiful to be at the Reichstag  with so many people"
    * "Beats an evening at home"
  - This "concert atmosphere type" issue exists in many other settings such as the Friday for Future gatherings, 1st-of-May demos or house squatting.
  - Such motivations dilute the effectiveness of the demonstration as a platform for serious political discourse.


**6. Analogies to Historical Atrocities:**

  - These demonstrations inappropriately draw parallels between current political debates and historical atrocities, such as the deportations executed by the Third Reich.
  - Using such analogies undermine the gravity of historical events and may lead to a distortion of the public's understanding of the past.



**7. Lack of Differentiation and Equating Dissimilar Acts:**

  - Demonstrations (intentionally?) fail to differentiate between acts of antisemitism committed by right-wing individuals and those committed by Islamic extremists.
  - Equating dissimilar acts oversimplify complex issues and hinder nuanced discussions on the roots and solutions to different forms of extremism.


**8. Equating Critique of Asylum Law with Xenophobia:**

  - Even moderate and highly emphatic people believe that the original and sweeping version of the unconditional right to asylum (from 1951!) needs urgent updates given that 
    * the world has become highly mobile; access to asylum is a privilege to those who can afford to travel,
    * that the hardships created by war or persecution are often quite similar to the extreme and inhuman sufferings caused by other disasters such as famines, earthquake, extreme poverty, crippling corruption and crime rates, ravaging diseases, etc...
    * the world has a "scaling problem": the "wealthy" countries cannot possibly afford to extend the benefits of asylum to the estimated 110 million displaced people, leave alone the billion+ humans that live below the human dignity threshold.
  - Demonstrations oversimplify discussions on the shortcomings of asylum laws, equating critical views with xenophobia and racism. 
  - This oversimplification impedes substantive discussions on necessary reforms to immigration policies.

### But don't we need to do **"something"** ?

This is an argument often brought forward: participating in these demonstrations is at least  doing "something", which should be better than doing nothing ?

I am not convinced this simple logic is true at all. On the contrary, for the reasons outlined above, actions that are not thought through well can create more harm than good.
I would argue that this is the case for the "Klimakleber" who are also think they have to "do something".

For what its worth, for myself I try to adhere to the following rules

1. **Avoid knee jerk reactions to news bites** that "prove" the evil character and intentions of a person or group. Before judging, **put in the time to understand the details**!! Many folks seem to not bother with the latter step. For example:
    * Do we fully know the details of the "deportation plan" which apparently triggered the demonstrations? Instead of unthinkingly conjuring up the "similar" deportation of the Jews by the Nazis, maybe there are aspects in the proposal that deserve an open discussion ? (We should not forget that naturalized citizenship is a privilege which ought to be revoked in extreme cases.) I myself would support "Abschiebung" of migrants in certain obvious cases:
      - Joining or supporting ISIS, Hamas or any other violent terror organization
      - Living on social welfare for a "long time"
      - Piling up severe criminal records
      - Instigating hate crimes
      - Blatant rejection of democratic and enlightened values such as (i) disrespecting the equality of women and men or religious beliefs, (ii) placing religious doctrines (e.g. the shariah) over the law or constitution, (iii) preaching violence toward certain groups of the population.
      - ....

2. **Do not allow yourself be instrumentalized!** 
(This is related to my point 3 from above) Yes, some of the outrage against and distancing from the AFD on the side of the established parties is likely to be based on honest feelings and applaudable moral guidelines. But clearly, some of it is simply sheer hostility towards Millions of lost votes. And the stubborn (I would claim undemocratic!) refusal to even talk to the party in the Bundestag which received 20% (!) of the votes (cast in fair and free elections) shows the desperation to stay in power. Yesterday's headline said that "Bundeskanzler Scholz lobt die Demonstrationen", which is not surprising, since they are indirectly support for his coalition.
The beautiful aspect of this "uprising against the right" is that inconvenient issues are ignored, such as

    * the gaping 60 billion hole in the federal budget
    * Germany is on track for its first two-year recession since the early 2000s after its economy shrank in 2023. See [IFO's opinion](https://www.tagesschau.de/wirtschaft/konjunktur/ifo-fuest-ampel-koalition-wirtschaft-rezession-100.html) on responsibilities.
    * Germany's CO2 emissions have not declined substantially despite the highest electricity costs in Europe
    * Anti-Jewish sentiment is surging in the large and growing Muslim community, much expanded by our openness to asylum seekers from a war-ravaged Middle East. (WSJ)
    * 30 percent of employees who come from the eight main countries of asylum (i.e. from the population groups that mainly consists of refugees) are claiming supplementary basic security benefits according to Social Security Code II (“Hartz IV”)
    * ....
    
3. **Look for the trade offs**, which are often deliberately masked by the dominating binary/polarized/black-and-white debates. 
In public policy, the omnipresence of trade-offs becomes evident as decisions made to address one issue inevitably have repercussions on others. (These are typically greatly exacerbated by the creative and relentless search for legal loopholes by clever humans.) For instance, 
    * allocating increased funding towards climate gas reductions, while essential for environmental sustainability, competes with resources earmarked for critical sectors like education and infrastructure.
    * Similarly, the establishment of generous social welfare programs, while promoting societal well-being, introduces a trade-off by potentially diminishing the incentive for individuals to engage in low-paying or challenging work.
    * The right to family reunification ("Familiennachzug") can be hailed as a basic humanitarian achievement but clearly has many [deeply troubling repercussions](https://www.tagesschau.de/investigativ/rbb/missbrauch-vaterschaftsanerkennung-100.html) 
    * Dual citizenship in case of democracies and autocracies:
      * are questionable when the two nations have conflicting political, economic, or social agendas.
      * can lead to dilemmas when making decisions on candidates or policies, as the interests of the two nations may not align.
      *  face challenges when reconciling divergent political and societal ideologies.
  

4. Be bothered by **double standards** and **vague terms**
  * Both the verb "hetzen" and the noun "Hetze" lack a clear definition but are used (particularly by the left) in a highly inflationary and often thoughtless way. In my view, any cynical or critical remark against left ideas of open borders and migration are immediately labeled as "Hetze". Examples:
    * [Light satirical comments](https://taz.de/Diskussion-um-Beitraege-bei-X/!5967323/)
  * The double standards w.r.t. to "hetzen" are also quite curious. Millions of demonstrators shouting "Nazis raus", "AFD ist menschenfeindlich" is not "Hetze"; it is also quite hip/fashionable these days to carry accessories with such slogans or post anti AFD signs on office doors in public buildings such as universities. For me indistinguishable but apparently criminal: [Polizei ermittelt wegen Hetzplakaten gegen die Grünen](https://www.rbb24.de/politik/beitrag/2024/02/brandenburg-prignitz-hetzplakate-polizei-ermittlungen-weisen-kuhblank.html)
  * Similar inflationary usage for the words "Hass", "rassistisch", "populistisch"...

### Postscript, European Elections (June 9, 2024)

* The massive losses of the Green party and the SPD are IMHO a direct consequence of the focus on demonizing "the right" and the refusal to talk about real issues.

* I hate to say "I told you so" but for me it makes perfect sense that the voters want to send these signals.

### Postscript, AFD Parteitag (June 29, 2024)

* During the demonstrations against the AfD party convention in Essen, [28 police officers were injured, one of them seriously](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article252260790/AfD-Parteitag-in-Essen-28-Polizisten-auf-Demo-gegen-AfD-Parteitag-verletzt.html). About 200 attackers are said to have attacked officers who were trying to escort delegates to the Grugahalle.

* What a disgrace! And how ironic that "Hetze, Hass und Ablehnung demokratischer Werte" are on full display by these left demonstrators.

* This is a direct consequence of the ever more heated public rhetoric that labels all right-wing individuals as Nazis and anti-democratic ! It is so dangerous because it contributes to a hostile environment where left-wing demonstrators feel justified in using violence, believing they are fighting against an existential threat. 

* How low can NRW-Ministerpräsident Hendrik Wüst (CDU) fall: 
 He apparently welcomed the Protest. „Die vielen Tausenden Demonstranten in Essen zeigen: In Nordrhein-Westfalen ist kein Platz für Hetze, Hass und Rechtsextremismus“, he said.
